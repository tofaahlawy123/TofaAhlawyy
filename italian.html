                                Manchester United paid Â£12m to sign Ronaldo in 2003, a record fee for a player of this
                                age. In the 2004 FA Cup Final, Ronaldo scored the first three goals for Manchester
                                United and helped them win the championship. In 2008, Ronaldo achieved the franchise
                                record of scoring goals. In 2009, Real Madrid paid a record $131 million for his
